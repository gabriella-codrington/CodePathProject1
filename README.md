## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some of my favorite apps include:

App 1: IMessage
- Editing sent messages
- Reacting to messages
- Special effects for occassions

App 2: Pinterest
- Auto save to specific board based on relevance
- Specification of curl pattern when searching for styles
- Reverse searching products

App 3: Instagram
- Unsending messages
- Customizing background
- Editing posts after posting

## Notes

I encountered the challenge of making my application more interesting than the initial idea. At first, it only changed the background color at the click of a button. Now it reveals my name, university, and occupation at the click of the first button and hides it again at the click of the second button.
